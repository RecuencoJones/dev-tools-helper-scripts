# DevTools Helper Scripts Extension

## Just, why?

I'm tired of "Copy as fetch" and having to manually type `<paste>.then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log(d))` when instead I can type with autocomplete `hack.logJSON(<paste>)`.

## Install

- Clone or download this repo
- Go to `edge://extensions` or `chrome://extensions`
- Make sure `Developer mode` is selected
- Click on `Load Unpacked`
- Select this folder
- Profit
